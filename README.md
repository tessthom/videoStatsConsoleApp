# videoStatsConsoleApp
A menu based console app to practice working with arrays, methods and the random class
<h1>Video Stats Analyzer</h1>
<p><strong>A menu based console app in C# that allows the user to select a number of videos in a range, populates arrays with random amounts of views and likes for each video, displays statistics for each video and finds the highest, lowest and average values for the videos</strong>
<br/>
  
<h2>About</h2>
A project to practice modular coding in C#, populating arrays with random values, passing arrays to methods and finding highest, lowest and percentage values from parallel arrays. 

<h2>Requirements</h2>

The app must ask the user to choose a number of videos 1-9, generate a random number of views up to 100,000,000,000 for each video, a random number of likes for each video, and store those values in parallel arrays. It then must display the number of views, likes and the percentage of views that are likes per video, followed by statistics that find the video with the most views, least views, most likes and least likes. This solution must be modular and thoroughly commented.

<h2>Key Concepts</h2>

- Populating arrays
- Passing arrays to methods
- Working with the Random class
- Displaying a menu and validating input
- Finding high, low and percentage values of arrays
